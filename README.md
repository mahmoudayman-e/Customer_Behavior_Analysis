📊 Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Data Analysis & Dashboarding
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data and ending with actionable insights visualized in a Power BI dashboard.
The goal is to showcase practical skills in Python, SQL Server, and Power BI, including data exploration, cleaning, querying, and visualization.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data relevant to business analysis (e.g., sales, customers, reviews, or transactions).

Source: (Add source if public, or mention “Provided dataset”)

Format: CSV / Excel

Size: (Optional)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

SQL Server

Power BI

Jupyter Notebook

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

🔄 Project Workflow

Load the dataset using Python

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Clean and preprocess the data

Store cleaned data in SQL Server

Run analytical SQL queries

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding data structure and data types

Identifying missing values and duplicates

Analyzing distributions and key metrics

Detecting outliers and inconsistencies

🧹 Data Cleaning

Handling missing and null values

Removing duplicates

Fixing data type issues

Cleaning text fields (e.g., trimming extra spaces)

Preparing data for SQL and visualization

🗄 SQL Analysis

Imported cleaned data into SQL Server

Wrote SQL queries to:

Aggregate metrics (counts, averages, totals)

Filter and segment data

Support business-related questions

Created optimized tables/views for reporting

📈 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Interactive filters and slicers

Trend analysis and comparisons

Clear visual storytelling for stakeholders

(Optional: Add screenshot or mention key visuals)

📌 Results & Insights

Identified key trends and patterns in the data

Highlighted important business metrics

Enabled data-driven decision-making through visuals
